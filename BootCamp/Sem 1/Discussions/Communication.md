# Communication as a Software Engineer

There are multiple focuses to being an enginner. It is common that people focus purely on programming but that is not enough to be an engineer. The other key part is **Communicating**.

#### Programming

* Abstractions
* Data Modelling
* Code

#### Communicating

	* Persuasion
	* Presentation
	* Storytelling

You will have to discuss a lot of what our code is and what it does to higher level (C Level (CEO CTO CFO)). The idea is how do we simplify to discuss at a lower level.

There are heaps of feelings/emotions that could make us feel uncomfortable with public speaking.



## Speach Structure/Model

|   S   |     Situation      | The Status Quo, The State of the World          |
| :---: | :----------------: | :---------------------------------------------- |
| **C** |    Complication    | The Impending Pain, Failure, Dire Circumstances |
| **I** |    Implication     | The Consequences for failing to act urgently    |
| **P** | Proposal(Position) | The axiom, your proposition self-evidently true |
| **A** |       Action       | The Demo!                                       |
| **B** |      Benefit       | ROI, TCO, Human Happiness                       |

It is so **<u>not</u>** important to <u>start</u> with the proposal as it doesn't build the importance.



## Delivery

1. Pausing
2. Color Spots
3. Great Demo

#### Pausing

The most important part of your speach is the pausing. You pause to convey important points and to keep a pace. Infront of an audience although pausing can be uncomfortable we can use a simple way to give us time to pause. We can count potato's. Count three to be precise. "1 Potato, 2 Potato, 3 Potato."

Normal Pause, Pacing = 3 Potatos

Important Point = 5 Potatos

The Big Reveal = 7 Potatos

You know they have finished thinking about the reveal when they start to look at you.

#### Color Spots

1. "Spontaneuous" Interaction
2. Analogies
3. Anectdotes

*Can be very usefull in any speech (Hands up if, What do you think? so on...)*

#### Great Demo

1. Tell them what you are about to do.
2. Tell them what they will see.
3. Do it. (Screen by Screen)
4. Tell them what you've just done.
5. Tell them what they've just seen.

DO THIS 2 TIMES (Static Demo and then a Dynamic Demo)

Static Demo is just screenshots. This allows you to fall back if something goes wrong in the Dynamic Demo.

Dyamic Demo is a working Demo.
