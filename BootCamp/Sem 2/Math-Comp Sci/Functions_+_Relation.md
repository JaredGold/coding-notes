# Functions and Relations

#### What is a relation?

A relation describes how one set of values maps or relates to another set of values.

Examples:

* The pairing between the people in our class and their birthdays
* The pairing between some set of numbers and the results of multiplying those numbers by 2
  * Example: s={1,2,3}, R(s)=s*2 = {(1,2,), (2,4), (3,6)}

#### What is a function?

A function is a relation with the condition that each element in the source set maps to only one element in the result set.

Said another way, a function takes inputs and produces a single output for each input (like in functional programming). It is possible that two different inputs produce the same output, but **<u>for every input, there is only one possible output</u>**.

Diagrams are used to seen if a function. For every number there can only be one line to the output.

A function can be shown through a; graph, pairs, code and an equation

#### Domain and range

All possible inputs to the function are called the **domain**. All possible outputs for the inputs in the domain is called the **range**. A function is ***mapped*** over elements of a **domain** to produce a **range** of values.

Example:

​	X = {1,2,3,4}

​	f(x) = x + 1

​	Map f(x) over X

What is the domain?

{1,2,3,4}

What is the range?

{2,3,4,5}

## Properties of Relations

### Reflexivity (=)

**XRy iff x=y**

(x relates to y if and only if x=y)

**Reflexivity** is the property that holds when for all elements in the domain, the relation pairs each element with itself. **Equality is reflexive**

Examples:

* The relation 'equal to' on the domain of all numbers is reflexive, because each number is equal to itself



### Transitivity (< . >)

**xRy, yRz => xRz**

(x relates to y and relates to z implies that x relates to z)

**Transitivity** is the property that holds when for all elements in the domain, for any **three** elements, if the relation pairs x and y and it pairs y and z, it also pairs x and z. **Comparative relations** are **transitive.** Transitive relations **<u>are not</u>** functions.

Examples:

* The relation 'less than' is transitive, because if x < y and y < z then x must be < z



### Symmetry

**xRy => yRx**

(x relates to y implies that y relates to x)

**Symmetry** is the property that holds when for all elements in the domain, if the relation pairs x and y, it also pairs y and x

Examples:

* The relation to 'cousins' is symmetric, because if Ted is Susan's cousin, then Susan is also Ted's cousin.
* The relation x + y = 5 is symmetric for the domain of Integers, because for every (x,y), there is also a (y,x) in the set formed by this relation (i.e., (1,4),(4,1),(2,3),(3,2))
