# Babel

* Babel is used in conjunction with React.
*  It compiles/transpiles the code from one type to another.
* It converts modern JS into pre-ES2015 syntax, as well as converts JSX to JS.

# Webpack

* Used for packaging code
* Gives compatibility with old browsers that don't support ES6 modules
* Also powers our local development server
