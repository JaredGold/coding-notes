# String Interpolation

String interpolation lets us insert code inside of a string. This allows our code to be much cleaner than before. 

In order for Interpolation to work you must use a double quote string a single quote is not enough.

```ruby
"Five plus five is #{5+5}"

"Santa's catch phrase is #{"Ho "*3}"

first_name = "Jared"

"My name is #{first_name}"
```
