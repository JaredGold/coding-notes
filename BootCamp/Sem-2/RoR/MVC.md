# Model View Controller (MVC)

## MVC Design Pattern

* The MVC design pattern is used with a number of languages for application development
* The application structure is broken down into three main parts, with each part serving a specific function, providing modularity
* Another advantage is that frameworks like Rails ca take advantage of convention to automate many aspects of building, running, and updating the application.
