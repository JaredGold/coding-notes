# Sets

A set is a group of **<u>unique items</u>** for some domain or universal set of items

Some examples:

If the domain is all pets, one set in the domain could be: {dog, cat, bird}

If the domain is the characters in the string "The bee buzzed", the set of characters in that domain is {'T', 'h', 'e', 'b', 'u', 'z', 'd'}



#### Sets in Math

In math, we use set notation to talk about sets. Here is some vocabulary:

* Domain - the larger collection from which a set is a part
* Element - an item in a set
* Subset - one set is contained within another set (may contain the exact same elements)
* Proper subset - one set is contained within another set and does not contain all elements of it's superset (they are not equal)
* Superset - one set contains another set
* Proper superset - one set contains another set and contains more than that subset (they are not equal)



### Combining Sets

#### union

Contains all elements that appear in either set (or)

A = {1,2,3,4}

B = {3,4,5,6}

A ⋃ B = {1,2,3,4,5,6}



#### intersection (and)

Contains only the elements that appear in both sets (and)

A = {1,2,3,4}

B = {3,4,5,6}

A ⋂ B = {3,5}



#### Complement (not)

Elements in the domain that are in the domain and not in the set (not)

Domain: All natural numbers < 10

A = {1,2,3,4}

B = {3,4,5,6}

(A ⋃X B)' = {7,8,9}

A' = {5,7,8,9}

B' = {1,2,7,8,9}



#### difference

All elements in one set that are not in another set'

A = {1,2,3,4}

B = {3,4,5,6}

A - B = {1,2}

B - A = {5,6}



#### Symmetric difference (xor)

All elements that are in either set but not in both (exclusive or)

A = {1,2,3,4}

B = {3,4,5,6}

A ⊕ B = {1,2,5,6}

### Subset and Superset

A = {1,2,3}

B = {1,2,3,4,5}



A is a proper subset of B					   A ⊂ B

A is a subset of B									A ⊆ B

B is a proper superset of A					B ⊃ A

B is a superset of A								 B ⊇ A

# Common domains and Notations

Natural Numbers

​	ℕ = Integers above Zero

Integers

​	ℤ = All positive and negative whole numbers

We can say that

ℤ ⊃ ℕ (integers are a proper superset of natural numbers)

*x*∉ℕ (x is an element of natural numbers)
